# Blocklist for first-3-letter groups.
# I'm only removing the ones that will never or almost never
# result in a word/name I could comfortably use.


##### OFFENSIVE OR DISTRACTING #####

nig
# A slur, and stays like a slur in most contexts (nigast, nigtal)

# neg (resembles negro) is on the edge,
# but is mostly from "negative" and "negotiations", and common in "neglect" etc
# and would typically be pronounced "nehg" and not "neeg"
# (negast, negtal)

jap
# A slur in many places, and sounds offensive in most contexts (japast, japtal)

jew
# Not a slur, but only makes words that sound like mean jokes (jewlia, jewdad)

sex
# Resulting word always starts with "sex", which is distracting.
# (sexast, sextal)

ass
# Same situation.
# (assast, asstal)

cum
# Same situation.
# (cumast, cumtal)
# Salvageable in some circumstances (cumulo), but not usually.

vag
# Same situation.
# (vagast, vagtal)
# Even more salvageable (vaggar, vaghty), but not often.


##### VERY LIMITED POSSIBLE DISTRIBUTION #####
# End with Q:
# acq req liq seq inq
# For now, these stay in.
# I can live with words like 'seqola' and 'liqail'.
# They're definitely odd, and probably less memorable
# than more well-behaved words like segola and liquil.
# But I wouldn't certainly reject them.
# Furthermore, the oddness of these sequences
# can be automated at a later stage (eg: Markov perplexity).


##### SPECIFIC TO ONE TYPE OF WORD #####
# Specific to surnames:
# mcc mcg
# For now, these stay in.
# I wouldn't necessarily reject mcgarm, mcchip, etc.


##### DEFY NORMAL SPELLING CONVENTIONS / INTUITION #####
# goe iow two peo bui anx lyi
# For now, these stay in.
# I don't prefer words like 'goella' and 'iownea',
# but they're really not so bad,
# and judgments of this kind are hard to make in large batches,
# and can be automated at a later stage (eg: Markov perplexity).
