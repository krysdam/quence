# List of forbidden 3-letter groups at the starts of words.
# These are only the 3-letter groups that always or almost always
# produce words I wouldn't be comfortable using,
# which would otherwise appear in the most common 1,296 sequences.

# Content warning: some of these sequences may be/resemble slurs or swears.


##### VERY LIMITED POSSIBLE DISTRIBUTION #####
# End with Q:
# acq req liq seq inq
# For now, these stay in.
# I can live with words like 'seqola' and 'liqail'.
# They're definitely odd, and probably less memorable
# than more well-behaved words like segola and liquil.
# But I wouldn't certainly reject them.
# Furthermore, the oddness of these sequences
# can be automated at a later stage (eg: Markov perplexity).


##### SPECIFIC TO ONE TYPE OF WORD #####
# Specific to surnames:
# mcc mcg
# For now, these stay in.
# I wouldn't necessarily reject mcgarm, mcchip, etc.


##### DEFY NORMAL SPELLING CONVENTIONS / INTUITION #####
# goe iow two peo bui anx lyi
# For now, these stay in.
# I don't prefer words like 'goella' and 'iownea',
# but they're really not so bad,
# and judgments of this kind are hard to make in large batches,
# and can be automated at a later stage (eg: Markov perplexity).


##### OFFENSIVE OR DISTRACTING #####

# Slurs,
# and sequences that otherwise tend to produce offensive-sounding words
