# I want a list of only the words that
# show the usual relationship between English spelling and pronunciation.
# So I'm excluding words not pronounced how they are spelled,
# and "words" that shouldn't be in Google Ngrams to begin with.

# Roman numerals: "viii" is pronounced "eight".
# Abbreviations:  "lbs" is pronounced "pounds".
# Initialisms:    "dna" is pronounced "dee en ay".
# Morphemes:      "tion" is never pronounced alone like that.
# Typos/mistakes: "ofthe" is an OCR artifact, not a real word of English.
# Unknown:        I don't know what "alr" is, but it can't be pronounced "alr".

# Merely unusual spelling or pronunciation doesn't condemn a word.
# "people" is pronounced "pee-pl" and not "pee-oh-pl",
# but nevertheless, that quirk is part of English's spelling system,
# while the words above are not.

# Just one reasonably common interpretation of a word is enough to save it.
# "Feb" is pronounced "February", and "Jan" is pronounced "January",
# but "Jan" is also pronounced "Jan" when it's the name "Jan", so "jan" stays.

# This gets subjective.
# Possibly somewhere, "biol" is commonly pronounced aloud as "by-ole",
# but in my English, "biol" is pronounced "biology".

# And actually, there are too many words like this to get them all.
# I only strictly checked the top 1296 3-letter prefixes and suffixes,
# and then only the first and second most common words that matched those.
# I think if a prefix/suffix has legitimate source words first and second,
# any subsequent illigitimate words probably don't make a difference anyway.

# Old timey: thee, thy, thou, hath, doth, hast, tis, twas, didst
# Many or all of these survive in certain expressions or genres/parodies.
# Native English speakers don't struggle to spell or pronounce them,
# and to me they seem to follow English's normal spelling system.

# They are nonstandard, but they don't defy English spelling.
